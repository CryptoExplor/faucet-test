# Overview

This is a comprehensive **Superchain Faucet** application built with React, TypeScript, and Express that allows users to claim testnet tokens across 10+ Superchain networks. The application integrates with Gitcoin Passport for verification and implements per-network rate limiting. Users can connect their wallets, select from multiple blockchain networks, verify their humanity through Gitcoin Passport scores, and claim testnet tokens with independent 7-day cooldowns per network.

The faucet includes **Farcaster Mini App** integration and uses a unified private key deployment across all Superchain networks for simplified management.
